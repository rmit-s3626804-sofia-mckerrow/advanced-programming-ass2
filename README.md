To run the program: unzip the Assignment2 folder -> open Eclipse -> create new Java Project called 'Ozlympics' -> from the unzipped Assignment2 folder copy the src folders, the Assets folder, the Documentation folder, the ozlympics.db file, the build.fxbuild file and the README.md file into the project.

JavaFX and SQLite are required to run this program. To add JavaFX to the project, right click on the Ozlympics project -> click 'Properties' -> click 'Java Build Path' -> click 'Libraries' tab -> click 'Add Library' -> click 'User Library' -> click 'Next' -> click 'User Libraries' - click 'New' -> type 'JavaFX' as the name and click 'OK' -> select JavaFX and click 'Add External JARs' -> go to where the Java folder is saved on your hard drive e.g. C:\Program Files\Java, then go to the jdk folder, then to the jre folder, then to the lib folder -> select the jfxswt.jar file and click 'Open' -> click 'OK' and then click 'Finish' -> click 'OK'.


To add SQLite to the project, right click on the JRE System Library folder in the Ozlympics project -> click 'Build Path' -> click 'Configure Build Path' -> click 'Add External JARs' -> go to the unzipped Assignment2 folder, then go to the Jar Files folder -> select the sqlite-jdbc-3.19.3.jar file and click 'Open -> click 'OK'.
